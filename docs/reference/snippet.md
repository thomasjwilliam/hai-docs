# Snippet

A snippet is a piece of text which allows you to quickly insert frequently used phrases, templates, or boilerplate text,
reduce repetitive typing and save time.

A snippet is defined by:

- **title**: a short description, used to explain the concept of the snippet
- **trigger**: a unique, case-insensitive word used to identify the snippet and "trigger" it while typing or referencing
  it in other snippets
- **note**: optional content in plain or markdown-formatted text to provide extra information about the snippet
- **text**: the actual snippet, written in plain or markdown-formatted text with twists and can be injected into
  your writing by selecting it from the library. A snippet has access to
  other snippets and macros, allowing you to compose an entire document automatically from different individual snippets
  of text.

A snippet can have multiple texts, published or drafted, and reordered.
