# Context

Context (from Latin contextus, con- 'together' + texere 'to weave') is the source of information you use when you are
composing notes, email replies, knowledge documents, etc. It is the webpage you visit or have open all the time in your
browser to get something done.

If you need to reply to a lot of emails, Gmail or Outlook is the context of your writing. If you interact with
customers, Zendesk or Jira might be the resources you use all the time. If you do research, maybe Wikipedia is your
source of information. If you are a developer, GitHub issues or discussions might be the context you write and respond
to a lot.

Context is not required to run the application, but when you do, it becomes much more useful because your snippets and
macros - and therefore your writing - becomes instantly context-aware.
